Project Type

Regression

Individual Contribution

Problem Statement

Yes Bank, a well-known financial institution in India, has faced significant fluctuations in stock prices due to various factors, including a fraud case involving Rana Kapoor in 2018. The project analyzes historical stock data to understand these fluctuations and predict future closing prices.

Features Used

Open Price: The price at which the stock opened for the day.

High Price: The highest price reached during the trading session.

Low Price: The lowest price recorded in the session.

Close Price: The price at which the stock closed for the day.

Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Imputation techniques were used to fill missing data.

Feature Engineering: Derived new features such as the mean of Open, High, and Low prices to improve prediction accuracy.

Data Visualization: Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to explore patterns in the dataset.

Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Model Evaluation Metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-Squared Score (R²)

Adjusted R² Score

Best Performing Model:

The XGBoost Regressor showed the highest R² score and adjusted R², making it the most suitable model for predicting the closing price.

Results & Insights

Stock prices showed volatility after 2018 due to financial scandals.

The mean of Open, High, and Low prices improved prediction accuracy.

XGBoost performed best in capturing stock price trends.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the ability to predict Yes Bank's closing stock price using machine learning models. The analysis showed that financial events significantly impact stock price movements. The best-performing model, XGBoost, provided the most accurate predictions, highlighting its strength in capturing complex patterns in stock price data. Future work can focus on integrating external factors such as economic indicators and news sentiment analysis to further enhance prediction accuracy.
